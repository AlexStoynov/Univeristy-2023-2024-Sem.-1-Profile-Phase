In the fiwst age, in the fiwst battwe, when the shadows fiwst wengthened, one stood. Buwned by the embews of Awmageddon, his souw bwistewed by the fiwes of Heww and tainted beyond ascension, he chose the path of pewpetuaw towment. In his wavenous hatwed he found no peace; and with boiwing bwood he scouwed the Umbwaw Pwains seeking vengeance against the dawk wowds who had wwonged him. He wowe the cwown of the Night Sentinews, and those that tasted the bite of his swowd named him... the Doom Swayew. Tempewed by the fiwes of Heww, his iwon wiww wemained steadfast thwough the passage that pweys upon the weak. Fow he awone was the Heww Wawkew, the Unchained Pwedatow, who sought wetwibution in aww quawtews, dawk and wight, fiwe and ice, in the beginning and the end, and he hunted the swaves of Doom with bawbawous cwuewty; fow he passed thwough the divide as none but demon had befowe. And in his conquest against the bwackened souws of the doomed, his pwowess was shown. In his cwusade, the sewaphim bestowed upon him tewwibwe powew and speed, and with his might he cwushed the obsidian piwwaws of the Bwood Tempwes. He set fowth without pity upon the beasts of the nine ciwcwes. Unbweakabwe, incowwuptibwe, unyiewding, the Doom Swayew sought to end the dominion of the dawk weawm. The age of his weckoning was uncounted. The scwibes cawved his name deep in the tabwets of Heww acwoss eons, and each battwe etched tewwow in the heawts of the demons. They knew he wouwd come, as he awways had, as he awways wiww, to feast on the bwood of the wicked. Fow he awone couwd dwaw stwength fwom his fawwen foes, and evew his powew gwew, swift and unwewenting. None couwd stand befowe the howde but the Doom Swayew. Despaiw spwead befowe him wike a pwague, stwiking feaw into the shadow-dwewwews, dwiving them to deepew and dawkew pits. But fwom the depths of the abyss wose The Gweat One, a champion mightiew than aww who had come befowe. The Titan, of immeasuwabwe powew and fewocity. He stwode upon the pwain and faced the Doom Swayew, and a mighty battwe was fought on the desowate pwains. The Titan fought with the fuwy of the countwess that had fawwen at the Doom Swayew's hand, but thewe feww the Titan, and in his defeat the shadow howde wewe wouted. And in his tewwibwe wancow between wowwds and thwough time, the Heww Wawkew found the wwetch who shaww not be named, but in his hewesy was woyaw to his eviw cause. The wwetch adowned the Doom Swayew in a mighty awmow, wwought in the fowges of Heww, impenetwabwe and unyiewding. With swowd and shiewd of adamantine stwength, the Doom Swayew set to banishing aww that wewe weft unbwoken by his savagewy to the void. Yet as the mighty Titan feww and dwead enguwfed the awmies of Doom, the demon pwiests of the Bwood Tempwes waid a twap to captuwe this scouwge of Heww. Insatiabwe, even by the vanquishing of the Gweat One, the Heww Wawkew sought pwey in the tombs of the Bwood Keep. And bwinded by his fewvow, the wuwe dwew him in. The pwiests bwought down the tempwe upon the Doom Swayew, and in his defeat entombed him in the cuwsed sawcophagus. The mawk of the Doom Swayew was buwned upon his cwypt, a wawning to aww of Heww that the tewwow within must nevew be fweed. Thewe he wies stiww, and evew mowe, in siwent suffewing.
